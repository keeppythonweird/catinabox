# Step 1: Checkout the untested source

In the first step, you will checkout the `catinabox` source and start the
server.

1. Fork [catinabox](https://github.com/keeppythonweird/catinabox).

2. Checkout your fork:

  ```bash
  christie@paw-paw:~$ git clone https://github.com/<MYUSERNAME>/catinabox.git
  ```

3. Before we try anything, let's update `pip` and `virtualenv` to make sure
   we're on the same page:
   
   ```bash
   christie@paw-paw:~$ pip install --upgrade pip
   christie@paw-paw:~$ pip install --upgrade virtualenv
   ```

4. Create a virtual environment for running `catinabox``:

  ```bash
  christie@paw-paw:~$ cd catinabox
  christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$ virtualenv catpy
  ```

5. Activate your virtual environment:

  ```bash
  christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$ source catpy/bin/activate
  (catpy)christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$
  ```

  You are now in your virtual environment, as indicated by the `(catpy)` prefix
  in your shell prompt.

6. Setup your development environment and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  (catpy)christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$ python setup.py develop
  ```

7. Run `catinabox` using the `cattery` entrypoint, which runs using
  [nameko](https://github.com/onefinestay/nameko)

  ```bash
  (catpy)christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$ nameko run catinabox.services.cattery_service
  ```

8. Observe the running `catinabox` webserver using your browser:

  [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Wow! `catinabox` runs! Great! But how confident are we that it does what
it's supposed to do?
