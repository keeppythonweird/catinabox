# Step 1: Checkout the untested source

In the first step, you will checkout the `catinabox` source and start the
server.

1. Fork [catinabox](https://github.com/keeppythonweird/catinabox).

2. Checkout your fork:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<MYUSERNAME>/catinabox.git
  ```

3. Create a virtual environment for running `catinabox``:

  ```bash
  christie@paw-paw:~$ cd catinabox
  christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$ virtualenv catpy
  ```

4. Activate your virtual environment:

  ```bash
  christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$ source catpy/bin/activate
  (catpy)christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$
  ```

  You are now in your virtual environment, as indicated by the `(catpy)` prefix
  in your shell prompt!

5. Run `catinabox` which runs using
  [nameko](https://github.com/onefinestay/nameko):

  ```bash
  nameko run cat_in_a_box
  ```

6. Observe the running `catinabox` webserver using your browser:

  [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Wow! `catinabox` runs! Isn't that great? But we have no tests :( I don't feel
100% confident shipping this production, let's add some tests first!
