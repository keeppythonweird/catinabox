# Step 2: Adding unit test coverage

In this step, you will run the existing unit tests and add some of your own.

1. Look at the existing unit tests:

  ```bash
  christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$ ls tests/unit
  ```

  We have two test files:
  * [test_pantry.py](../tests/unit/test_pantry.py)
  * [test_cattery.py](../tests/unit/test_cattery.py)

2. Run the existing unit tests:

  ```bash
  py.test tests/unit
  ```
  
3. Add more unit tests to both `test_pantry.py` and `test_cattery.py` until
   you are confident that they are well covered.
   
   Verify your tests are working by intentionally breaking them (i.e. change
   the logic in `Cattery` and `Pantry` to be incorrect and ensure your
   tests fail).

4. If you get stuck, take a peek at [the solution](https://github.com/keeppythonweird/catinabox/tree/step2/tests/unit).
