# Step 4: Add system test coverage

In this step, you will add system tests to catinabox.

1. Look at the existing system tests:

  ```bash
  christie@paw-paw:~/catinabox$ ls tests/system
  ```

  We have one test file:
  * [test_cattery_service.py](../tests/system/test_cattery_service.py)

2. Run the existing system tests:

  ```bash
  py.test tests/system
  ```
  
3. Take a look at the supporting test code in
   [conftest.py](../tests/system/conftest.py).
   
   The filename `conftest.py` instructs `py.test` to look in this file for
   fixture classes.
   
   Notice also the class `HttpBaseClient`, a wrapper around `requests` which
   makes calling methods on the service in tests a bit less verbose.
  
4. Add more system tests to `test_cattery.py` until you feel the coverage
   is adequate. Remember that you don't need to test every path.
 
5. When you are done, commit your changes and push to your pull request:
  
  ```bash
  christie@paw-paw:~$ git commit -a
  christie@paw-paw:~$ git push origin master
  ```
  
  You should see the CI builds succeed.
   
6. If you get stuck, take a peek at [the solution](TODO: git tag).
