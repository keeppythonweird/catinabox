Intro to Testing and Test Automation in Python

This repo holds a tutorial which will walk you through:
- Adding unit test coverage to a project with no tests
- Adding system tests to a separate webserver
- Observing test success and coverage using
  [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).
- Adding a new feature with test coverage using TDD (with both unit and
  system testing)
