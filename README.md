This repo holds a tutorial which will walk you through adding unit tests,
exploring these features of unit testing in general and pytest in particular:
- Basic unit testing
- Observing test success and coverage using
  [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).

# Requirements

2. Python (2.7 or 3.x) with:
  - pip
  - virtualenv
5. Git (either Github for Windows or command-line git)
6. Text editor or IDE (e.g. Pycharm)

# Tutorial Steps

1. [Setup and run tests](./steps/1-run_tests.md)
2. [Test a simple function](./steps/2-simple_function.md)
3. [Create and build a pull request](./steps/3-pull.md)
4. [Testing incorrect input](./steps/4-input.md)
5. [Testing classes with fixtures](./steps/5-classes.md)
6. [Using mock and patch](./steps/6-mock.md)
7. [Parameterized tests](./steps/7-params.md)
8. [Refactoring for unit testability](./steps/8-refactor.md)
